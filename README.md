Abstract: This is a completely self-designed **Password Login System** on the front-end and back-end. We simulated the scenes of user registration and login in real web pages. We **encrypt** the user information on the back-end and adopt **hint** method to prevent the **clone** website.

There are 2 branches in this Github repository which are PlatformFrontEnd and HashPasswordAPI. Please navigate through each branches to find out more abouth the front-end and back-end part of the platform.
